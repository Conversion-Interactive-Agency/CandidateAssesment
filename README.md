# Conversion Interactive Candidate Test

## instructions
Please Build a landing page for a potential job seeker. We have included all the assets that you need inside 
the IMG folder. Feel Free to use filler text or lorem ipsum for the content on the mockup file, we are really not
focusing on that part of this assessment. Please clone or download this repository for the candidate assessment.

### Rules
 - If you use a library (css/javascript) please explain why you chose it. 
 - Don't worry about Validating the form but please create the form with the proper action
 - Please make the landing page responsive.
 - Please create a menu with the following options "Company", "Drivers", and "About". Build the menu as you
   see fit. We would like to see some of your creativity.
 - Please use FontAwesome 5 for your icons (e.g. arrow icons, search icons ...) Use this link below to pull it into
 this project
   
   ``` <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.2/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-HK5fgLBL+xu6dm/Ii3z4xhlSUyZgTT9tuc/hSrtw6uzJOvgRr2a9jyxxT1ely+B+xFAmJKVSTbpM/CuL7qxO8w==" crossorigin="anonymous" />```  
  to pull in font awesome.
- you can find the DOCS here ```https://fontawesome.com/```
- Links on the page do not have to go anywhere.



### Bonus Points
- create an animation,or an effect on the "apply now" button and on the arrow towards the bottom of the page.
- create a cookie that value is equal to the url and expires in a month
- You can use the colors red, black and White but it would be pretty cool if you can actually pull the hex values
